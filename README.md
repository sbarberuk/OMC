Oracle Management Cloud Utilities

This project consists of several utilities to help with maanaging and using Oracle Management Cloud.  It is not a replacement for the official utilities, documentation or support.  These are just tools that have made my life easier.

Starting at the beginning with some very simple shell/python scripts to do things like getting a list of downloadable agents or installing agents or simply listing entities.  The intention is to extend this to more sophisticated tools and utilities.
